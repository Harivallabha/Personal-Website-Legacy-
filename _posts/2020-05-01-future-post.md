Haule Haule (Slowly Slowly).

Throughout my academic endeavour, I've found a great anchor in a particular pair of maxims. I grew up with my grandparents, and it is uncanny how my granma, with little formal education, seemed to have the right approaches to deal with most situations, academic or otherwise. The first, _"Paada Paada Raagam, Mooda Mooda Rogam"_ literally translates to - The more you sing, the better you get at singing. And, the more you hide, the worse becomes your disease. And the second, _"Kathinda Vidhai Illai"_ means - The moment you learn something, it's no more complex. In my opinion, these two maxims best encapsulate my approach towards the academic endeavour, and in my limited experience, I've found them to serve me astonishingly well. 

The first principle is a surrogate for the growth mindset (_Carol Dweck_) -- The more you practise, the better you get. It equips you with a frame of mind wherein you evaluate yourself or your results based on a function of the efforts that you put in, and does away with the notion of an ingrained, and immutable talent. And the second essentially tells me that the moment I understand a complex topic, it becomes simple. It's no more complex. I'm sure you've experienced this feeling too. Ever been overwhelmed by some topic filled with words and symbols that appear complex, mysterious and intimidating only to find it beautiful, and aesthetic and disarmingly simple? That's what I'm talking about.

So, keep practising. The moment you accomplish a seemingly complex task, you'll understand how simple it actually is. Wait for this feeling, work towards this feeling. Computationally. And before you know it, Haule Haule Ho Jaayega Pyaar Sajna :)
