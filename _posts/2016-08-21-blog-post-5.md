So, starting this week I'm gonna code up a small module of a selected paper each week, for the next 52 weeks. Looking forward to some interesting picks. I'll be adding these implementations to a GitHub repo dedicated to this, "Project 52.0". I'll be documenting the progress and noting down interesting thoughts :)

Lassss goooo!
