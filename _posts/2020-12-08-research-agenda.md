How can we make use of the rich, and powerful modeling offered by PDEs? And, combine that with the function approzimation capabilities of neural networks? Impose prior beliefs by placing all of this within a Bayesian framework?

I believe that the interpretability, and mathematical rigor associated with the Bayesian stat. literature combined with the ability of neural networks to learn representations would unlock new planes of mathematical, and computational modeling. I envisage a future in research where we see an increasing adoption of neural networks as a black-box function approximator within a PDE-based modeling of phenomena, placed in a Bayesian framework. Personally, this is a very exciting thought. I think that a combination of these three independent, poweful _paradigms_ would redefine our understanding of the world.

At the moment, I am quite passionate about employing these _tools_ to gain a better understanding of the human brain. As Robert Kass rightly notes, _Brain Research is underserved by Statistics_. I can't imagine what the world of Probabilistic ML, and physics-informed neural networks has in store for brain research.
